Every thread has 3 states:
   * RUNNING
   * STOPPED
   * WAITING

The first 2 are self-explanatory.

The WAITING state is entered by a call to svcWaitSynchronization(N).

In WAITING state there are 3 parameters:
   * wait_list - an array of handles that the thread is waiting for
   * wait_list_length
   * wait_all  - a boolean whether to continue execution after all or just one

Upon a thread-switch, if the thread is in WAITING state the following will be executed (psuedocode):

     if state == RUNNING:
        return true

     else if state == STOPPED:
        return false

     else if state == WAITING:
        if wait_all:
           for each handle in wait_list:
               if handle.is_waiting():
                  // this thread is still blocked..
                  return false
        else:
           for each handle in wait_list:
               if not handle.is_waiting():
                  // this thread can run now!
                  return true
